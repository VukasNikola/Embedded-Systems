This repository documents my journey into **embedded systems development**, from first experiments to structured projects.  

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered  
- **Microcontrollers:** Arduino/ATmega, ESP32  
- **Low-level programming:** Bare-metal coding with datasheets and technical reference manuals  
- **Real-time systems:** FreeRTOS tasks, queues, and inter-task communication  
- **Peripherals & protocols:** IÂ²C, UART, SPI, GPIO, PWM, sensors, and displays  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  
- Build a solid foundation in embedded programming through **hands-on projects**  
- Develop transferable skills for **embedded engineering** and **real-time applications**  
- Keep track of progress, lessons learned, and code examples  

## ðŸš€ Structure  
The repo is organized into project folders. Each contains:  
- Source code (`.ino` or `.c/.cpp`)  
- Notes and explanations  
- Supporting media (images, diagrams, etc.)  

## ðŸ“ˆ Why This Repo?  
This project serves both as a **personal log** of my progress and a **resource** for others beginning their embedded systems journey.
