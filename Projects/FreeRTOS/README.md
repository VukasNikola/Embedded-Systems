# FreeRTOS Learning

This repository documents my progress learning **FreeRTOS** for embedded systems.  
I am following along with the YouTube series by [Digi-Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F321087yYy4&list=PLXyB2ILBXW5FLc7j2hLcX6sAGbmH0JxX8), while expanding with my own notes, experiments, and code snippets.

## ðŸ“š Goal
- Build a strong foundation in **RTOS concepts** (tasks, scheduling, queues, semaphores, mutexes, timers, ISRs, etc.).
- Apply FreeRTOS on microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, STM32).
- Create reference notes and working examples I can revisit later.
- Grow towards being comfortable enough to use FreeRTOS in real embedded projects.
